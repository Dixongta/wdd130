What did you learn from the websites on careers in web design and development, and what did you learn from this class in general?

There are many options for this career, besides that the salary ranges are really good. I was able to research other careers like Network engineering which is something that I do right now. I believe that mixing these 2 careers can help to better understand how to solve issues related to web applications.
